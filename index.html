      <h3>Learn the Skills to Land the Job</h3>
      <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
         Most of the world continues to use outdated education models and hiring practices, yet expects more diverse,
         inventive, and motivated tech talent.
         We believe in hiring differently.
         We're on a mission to connect passionate, qualified individuals with employers in need of skilled tech talent.
         We offer FREE tech education and job-readiness training.
         Qualified individuals are matched with an apprenticeship at one of our employer partners who need tech talent,
         ranging from Fortune 500 companies to fresh new start-ups. More than four out of five of our apprenticeships
         result in a full-time job offer, and most LaunchCoders double their previous salary after landing a job.</p>

         <h3>Taking Learning to the Next Level</h3>
         <p>
            At LaunchCode, we know that while talent is widely distributed among the population, opportunity is not.
            We aim to change that by making quality tech education based on job market needs free and accessible.
            Learning skills that lead to an in-demand job in technology shouldn't demand years of your life, piles of
            money up front, or part of your paycheck down the road â€” it should be available to all those who have the
            passion, drive, and aptitude to build the skills and land the job, regardless of one's background.
            We offer part- and full-time courses to take you from zero experience to ready for your first job in tech in
            months, not years.Let's get started by determining where to start your learning journey.</p>
